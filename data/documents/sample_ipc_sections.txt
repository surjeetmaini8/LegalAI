Key Legal Principles:

1. Essential Elements of Criminal Breach of Trust:
   - Entrusting of property
   - Dishonest misappropriation or conversion
   - Violation of legal direction or contract

2. Degrees of Punishment vary based on:
   - Position of trust (public servant, banker, agent)
   - Nature of relationship (carrier, clerk, servant)
   - Severity of breach

3. Criminal breach of trust differs from theft in that the accused must have been legally entrusted with the property.

4. The prosecution must prove dishonest intention at the time of misappropriation.

Landmark Cases:

1. Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. State of Bombay (1956): Supreme Court held that to constitute criminal breach of trust, there must be an entrustment of property and dishonest misappropriation or conversion.

2. State of West Bengal v. Mir Mohammad Omar (2000): Supreme Court clarified that intention to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain is essential for establishing dishonesty.

3. R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay (1984): The Court held that mere civil liability does not amount to criminal breach of trust unless dishonest intention is proved.
